# classical-mechanics
This repository contains numerical solutions to selected problems for Classical Mechanics (5th edition) by John Taylor

The purpose of this project is mainly for me to practice scientific computing in the python language.  Additionally, others may benefit from seeing some numerical solutions.  Disclaimer: I am not a software developer by trade, my background is in mathematics and mechanical engineering.  I have made efforts to keep code clean and documented, but by no means do I assert that my solutions are the best solutions.

Each jupyter notebook contains a single solution to a single problem, that walks through the problem setup and numerical solution.  In addition, I re-solve some of the examples in the text to (1) verify my code is correctly solving problems and (2) for additional practice.

Enjoy
